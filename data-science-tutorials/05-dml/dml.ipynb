The second equation keeps track of confounding, namely the dependence of the treatment variable on controls.\n",

Once we are able to account for all confounding variables $X$ in our analysis, we can consistently estimate the causal parameter $\\theta_0$. A difference to the PLR refers to assumptions on the functional form of the main regression equation. Whereas it is assumed that the effect of $D$ on $Y$ in the PLR model is additively separable, the IRM model comes with less restrictive assumptions.\n",

The doubly robust estimator is consistent if either the machine learning estimator of $m_0(X)$ or $g_0(X)$ is consistent.\n",
