Many household under low food security benefit from WIC. We are curious to know the causal effect of WIC on food security status.\n",

        "We use the 2020 Current Population Survey (CPS) Food Security Supplement (FSS) data to estimate the causal effect of WIC on food security status. We screen the eligible household (below 185 percent of the poverty threshold, with children under age 5 or women aged 15-45). Besides, we set another eligibility criteria that the household must have at least 1 food insecure event in the past 30 days, because we are interested in the causal effect of WIC on food security status among households that suffered from food insecurity.\n",

        "- `HRNUMHOU`: Number of people in the household.\n",
