At the leaves of the tree, the model specifies a distribution over the output for points that are in that part of the input space.\n",

        "The decision trees suffer from high variance. This means that if we split the training data into two parts at random, and fit a decision tree to both halves, the results that we get could be quite different.\n",

        "\n",
        "Bagging has been demonstrated to give impressive improvements in accuracy by combining together hundreds or even thousands of trees into a single procedure.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Random forests\n",
        "\n",
        "Random forests provide an improvement over bagged trees by way of a small tweak that decorrelates the trees. As in bagging, we build a number of decision trees on bootstrapped training samples. But when building these decision trees, each time a split in a tree is considered, a random sample of $m$ predictors is chosen as split candidates from the full set of $p$ predictors. **The split is allowed to use only one of those** $m$ **predictors**. Using a small value of m in building a random forest will typically be helpful when we have a large number of correlated predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Boosting\n",
        "\n",
        "Boosting works in a similar way as bagging, except that **the trees are grown sequentially**: each tree is grown using information from previously grown trees. Boosting does not involve bootstrap sampling; instead each tree is fit on a modified version of the original data set.\n",
        "\n",
        "For binary classification problem, each classifier $F_m \\in \\{-1, +1\\}$. In particular, we first $F_1$ on the original data, and then we weight the data samples by the errors made by $F_1$, so misclassified examples get more weight. Next we fit $F_2$ to this weighted data set. We keep repeating this process until we have fit the desired number $M$ of components.\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be shown that, as long as each $F_m$ has an accuracy that is better than chance (even on the weighted dataset), then the final ensemble of classifiers will have higher accuracy than any given component. That is, if $F_m$ is a **weak learner** (so its accuracy is only slightly better than 50%), then we can boost its performance using the above procedure so that the final f becomes a **strong learner**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that boosting reduces the bias of the strong learner, by fitting trees that depend on each other, whereas bagging and RF reduce the variance by fitting independent trees. In many cases, boosting can work better (but take more time to train).\n",
